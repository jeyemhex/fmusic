# FMusic

## Introduction
So I thought I'd finally try writing some music in Fortran. Don't ask me why,
it's obviously a bad idea. Honestly, at this point I don't think there's any
hope left for me.

## Usage
```
$ gfortran ./main.f90
$ ./a.out
```

## Requirements
  - A Fortran compiler (tested on GFortran 11.2)
  - aplay from Alsa
  - Not to have have/need a file at `/tmp/audio.pipe`. You've been warned!
